\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this plan is to define the e-store Software Quality Assurance (SQA) organization, SQA tasks and responsibilities; provide reference documents and guidelines to perform the SQA activities; provide the standards, practices and conventions used in carrying out SQA activities; and provide the tools, techniques, and methodologies to support SQA activities, and SQA reporting.
	
\subsection{Scope}
This plan establishes the SQA activities performed throughout the life cycle of the e-store project.

This plan shall implement a project that follows the RESTful architectural style. The project shall be developed using the Flask microframework. There will be a clear separation of concerns between the client and the server for easy maintenance and scalability.

\section{Management}
This section describes each major element of the organization that influences the quality of the software.

\subsection{Organization}

The team shall follow the agile approach, and adhere to the scrum approach in development. The team shall consist of the Scrum Master, Product Owner and the Development Team. Throughout each iteration, SQA activities should be headed by the Scrum Master who shall also serve as the Quality Assurance Manager. The team shall follow the Behaviour-driven approach in development as an extension to the Test-driven development approach. Prior to coding any functionality, the individual responsible for the feature shall create just enough acceptance tests, unit tests and code to pass the tests. 

\subsection{Tasks}
The SQA team’s main task is to check whether the procedures are followed and that standards are handled correctly as defined in the [SQAP]. Additionally, the SQA team inspects whether all group members fulfill their tasks according to the parts of the [SQAP] applying to their specific tasks. \\

Besides the described main task, the SQA team has to check the consistency and coherence between documents.

\subsection{Responsibilities}
The responsibility of Quality Assurance shall be vested in all of the members of the development team. Each one shall serve as a tester and developer at the same time. However, a Software Quality Assurance Manager (QAM) shall be the one to oversee that the BDD approach is followed, and that tests cover 100 percent coverage throughout the system, in order to avoid any bleeds or regression. The agile team shall be self-organizing individuals and take full responsibility in the feature or story assigned to them. The team shall not only be concerned with the product quality but also with the process quality and relationship between them. Should there be any major problems, the QAM shall take over and plan as needed. 

\newpage
\section{Documentation}
The documents to be delivered in the specific phases of the project will be based in Chapter 4. Document standards are described in the same chapter.

\newpage
\section{Standards, Practices, Conventions And Metrics}
\subsection{Documentation Standards}
Documentations may be in the form of a test, a docstring, or any formal document. If possible, the code should serve as enough documentation for the system. Throughout the project, PEP 8 style guide convention shall be used. 

\subsubsection{PEP 8 basically commands developers the following practices: }
\begin{itemize}
\item Indentation: Indent with 4 real spaces (no tabs)
\item Maximum line lenght: 79 characters with a soft limit for 84 if absolutely necessary. Try to avoid too nested code by cleverly placing break, continue and return statements.
\item Continuing long statements: To continue a statement you can use backslashes in which case you should align the next line with the last dot or equal sign, or indent four spaces.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Docstrings}
All docstrings shall be formatted with reStructuredText as understood by Sphinx. Depending on the number of lines in the docstring, they are laid out differently. If it’s just one line, the closing triple quote is on the same line as the opening, otherwise the text is on the same line as the opening quote and the triple quote that closes the string on its own line:

\subsubsection{Comments}
Rules for comments are similar to docstrings. Both shall be formatted with reStructuredText. If a comment is used to document an attribute, put a colon after the opening pound sign $(\#)$. 

\subsection{Design Standards}

The system shall follow the restful-architectural style. The API backend shall be built with Flask, while the frontend (running in a different port) shall be built with AngularJS. The following table describes the API model of the project:

\hline
\textbf{Resource} & \textbf{URI} & \textbf{HTTP Method} & \textbf{Action} & \textbf{Data Params} \\
\hline

 & $/api/v1/product/id$ & GET & Retrieve single product & \\
 & $/api/v1/product/$ & POST & Create new product & \\
& $/api/v1/product/id/$ & PUT & Update single product & \\

ProductType & $/api/v1/productType$ & GET & Retrieve all product types & \\

Site & $/api/v1/site$ & GET & Retrieve all sites & \\ 
Order & $/api/v1/order$ & GET & Retrieve all orders from a site, and current user & \\
Page & $/api/v1/order$ & GET & Retrieve all pages from site. & \\

\section{Training}
The project requires sufficient skill in Python, Flask, and front end technologies like Angular, jQuery and Ajax. The learning curve throughout the project development has been steep and required training from the Advisor and co-team members. 

\section{Risk management}

\subsection{Categories of risks}
The following are categories of risks that are relevant to the project: 

\subsubsection{Risks with respect to the work to be done}
\textbf{1. Miscommunication} \\
\textit{Probability:} High \\
\textit{Prevention:} Daily stand ups or quick huddle should be done by the team on a regular basis. Major weekly meetings are done to keep address pressing issues in development. Team members should not hesitate to ask and re ask questions if things are unclear in order to avoid bottlenecks in the progress of the system. With regards to the customer, bi-monthly face-to-face meetups should be done to update and keep track of progress. If any confusions arise, the team may opt to use other communication mediums like phone calls, or emails to clear up problems. \\
\textit{Correction:} When it becomes clear that miscommunication is causing problems, the team members involved and the customer are gathered in a meeting to clear things up. \\
\textit{Impact:} High \\
